# 👋 Welcome to my profile

My name is Bruno, and I'm a backend developer.

In my job I use a lot of _.NET_, _Java_ and _SQL_ to develop robust and scalable Web APIs.

I also use a lot of _Python_ for scripting and automation, trying to create easy solutions for repetitive tasks.

In my free time, I mainly use _C++_ to develop performance critical applications, such as Game Engines and Compilers.

I have a dream to one day fully develop and publish a game of my own.
